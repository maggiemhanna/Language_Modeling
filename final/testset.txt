i think what i love most about needful things though is the originality of the story and the appeal of gaunts sadistically fun plan for people to plan pranks on others i can just imagine stephen king standing in front of a corkboard with push pins and strings constructing the web of whos fighting with who and who plays the pranks that set them off the supernatural element of the novel is somewhat downplayed so that the story can focus more on the characters and the effect that gaunts tricks are having on them yes gaunt is a demon who steals souls and seems to know just about everything about everybody in town and has eyes that frequently change color and is able to repulse anybody with just a touch but that is the real extent of the supernatural that we get its the characters that are really at the forefront here and what is brought out in them when their biggest fears are shoved in their faces and i love the way that king chose to present that with this story its a highly original idea and it completely works with what king was trying to say his writing style in this book is also what most people refer to as vintage king like hes slightly sophisticated but still naughty and nasty at the same time

a reader should avoid thinking of psychologist in too narrow of a sense since in pre-freudian times the term was used rather loosely to denote the introspective individual who made it a habit to observe the deeper working of human consciousness no degree was required nietzsche is convinced that a slave revolt has occurred in the history of mankind and that contemporary human perspective is clouded by the parasitic judgment of the weaker moralist the common man does not detect it because it favors his herd-instinct but the individuals who still possess a trace of the noble spirit are left bemused by the happenings of their surroundings they understand that at some basic level something is awry but a lifetime of indoctrination into the slave-morality has made them incapable of finding the source of their unease the inculcation is so deep that the psychologist will seek the everyday well-ordained people because he always requires a cure that he needs as kind of escape and forgetting away from all that with which his insights his incisions his craft have burdened his consciencein other words he must numb himself in order to persist he must dumb himself in order to go on living

i recently had another negative revelation one that was slow in coming because of where i fit in the historical timeline a colleague who is a famous sideshow artist saw it long before i did and is pretty outspoken about it its that lettermans detachment and irony are actually hostile and harmful to the variety arts i happen to cherish mostly because i hadnt watched the show for a couple of decades i had forgotten about this i mostly remember letterman as somebody who helped revive interest in old school show bizhis sensibility was about bringing all sorts of american freaks before the cameras what i had forgotten was the extent to which he makes fun of them he doesnt celebrate them he makes comedy at their expense not along ago i wrote profiles of most of the variety performers whove played in my american vaudeville theatre many of them have letterman credits and when i played their clips i found myself shocked at the lack of respect lettermans program showed to artists i admire a great deal ultimately letterman has that baby boomer perspective that ridicules the very idea of performers like ventriloquists rope twirlers magicians and so forth as corny apparently he is so out of touch now that he has virtually no idea that such performers are vastly hipper than he is seems to me theres a niche there there oughtta be some space for it on yer television

these policy changes are all predicated on a lack of trust its the administrations way of saying we dont trust our teachers to use good judgement and to act in the best interest of the kids in some cases that might be justified there are certainly teachers who shouldnt be teachers but thats a separate problem that needs to be addressed on an individual basis my students trust me to help them when they need it and their parents trust my judgement to always know and do whats right for their kids that trust wasnt given it was earned and in my opinion if youre a teacher you have to earn that kind of trust in order to do your job the administration needs to recognize that and they need to take steps to make sure every single teacher earns that kind of trust and respect from the students and their parents and then they need to back off and trust us to do our jobs

i have always loved eating yeasted bread but making them is a whole different story and feeling entirely thats why when this bread came out of the oven i was over the moon it was my first whole wheat sandwich bread and luckily i managed to make it somewhat successfully on my first attempt however i feel that i would need to make this again more properly next time when i read that this bread grows very large and rises a lot i took out my biggest bread pan a inch one just to be sure but it was apparently too big for the recipe instead of rising upward my dough expanded to fill the sides of the pan resulting in a very large but very horizontal loaf i believe a inch pan would be perfect for the job although a inch pan would be all right as well but no bigger and even though i didnt get the gorgeous round head i always look for in homemade sandwich breads let me just say this is one of the softest and most delicious whole wheat sandwich breads ive had there are notes of olive oil in the bread and when you bite off the crust you get a burst of sweetness from the brush of honey applied before the dough is baked

these young people were so excited about living in nebraska some of them had spent time elsewhere before choosing to move back to nebraska and eventually choosing to find a small town to raise their families or have the rural way of life another theme that emerged throughout the conference was the need to get young people involved in the local community such as youth representatives on city council etc even as early as when theyre in high school some people think small town communities in nebraska are deadbut thats not necessarily the case it mostly depends on leadership-a strong leader will rally the town around an idea to grow it or create opportunities thats whats happening in ord ne with caleb pollard another example comes from fairfield iowa sometimes it just takes the right person to ignite a spark and help the rest of the town see the possibilities nebraska has so much to offer

for me there is something rather thin about the characterization in this story certainly the great gatsby is a much shorter book than say middlemarch or the pursuit of love however i think fitzgeralds story would have done better to be a little longer and spend more time addressing the characters take daisy for example i never felt that i really knew or understood daisy and she is arguably the most important female character in the story indeed as i have said i found most of the characters in this story extremely hard to understand and thus even harder to relate to dont get me wrong i did enjoy reading this book but not for my usual reasons normally if i enjoy a book it has well-drawn characters strong depictions of the dynamics at play between two people and an insight into society in general i did not find these things in my reading of the great gatsby

this novel is by no means perfect but its failings come from ambition rather than lack of talent which krauss seems to have in spades there is a feeling that comes from reading the work of a mature writer an ease that you are in the hands of someone who has something to say this usually comes from writers far more experienced than krauss but her maturity is just one of the attractive features in this novel about a desk and the various hands it passes through characters created with such detail that they cease to feel like characters at all and the novel as a whole written with a complexity that forces the reader to slow down and appreciate the thought intelligence and humanity that has gone into creating it

in this scenario is there any such thing as sin to be sure there is crime which is merely a violation of law against a human for which we might be accountable before a human court but there is no sin in the sense of a violation of gods holy law a transgression against the holy one if we claim we have not sinned we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives or all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god so if there is no ultimate sin then of what need is there for redemption and if there is no need for redemption of what need is there of christ why we might as well say christ jesus did not even exist if all that is true and we might as well say that all that is in scripture is untrue as well

the final point of synthesis relates to the typological nature of circumcision regardless of what any others might say it seems consistent within the biblical text to connect circumcision with regeneration this is most obvious in colossians where spiritual circumcision and regeneration is connected to baptism as opposed to physical circumcision one interesting implication of this would be the relationship between the sealing aspect of abrahams circumcision in romans and the sealing role of the holy spirit in other parts of the nt eph cor yet such a connection would be difficult to prove based on a passing statement of pauls its clear that the sealing role of circumcision for abraham was quite different from that of the holy spirit so the relationship is somewhat ambiguous of course the crucial distinction to be made is the nature of the type in physical circumcision and its fulfillment in the antitype of regeneration and increased freedom from sin regarding such a relationship justin martyr said

ive seen several reviews suggesting that this movie is more seduced by hollywood than what price hollywood and some other behind-the-scenes films however im not sure this is fair there isnt all that much dwelling on glamour except for a scene where vicki is caked with unappealing make-up including a joan crawford mouth and there are plenty of scenes where the spiteful backbiting nature of the star machine comes across for instance in the catty remarks various people make about norman as soon as he is out of earshot gloating over his woes especially the press agent matt libby lionel stander someone libby even makes a cruel joke when norman has drowned himself commenting its the first drink of water hes had in years must admit i find the drowning scene itself hard to take it somehow seems too smooth and easy compared to the messiness and horror of lowell shermans death in what price hollywood but this sardonic reaction gives back some sharpness as does the funeral scene where fans pursue a weeping vicki demanding autographs

in the first place nobody else but god would ever have thought of justifying those who are guilty they have lived in open rebellion they have done evil with both hands they have gone from bad to worse they have turned back to sin even after they have smarted for it and have therefore for a while been forced to leave it they have broken the law and trampled on the gospel they have refused proclamations of mercy and have persisted in ungodliness how can they be forgiven and justified their fellowmen despairing of them say they are hopeless cases even christians look upon them with sorrow rather than with hope but not so their god he in the splendour of his electing grace having chosen some of them before the foundation of the world will not rest till he has justified them and made them to be accepted in the beloved is it not written whom he did predestine them he also called and whom he called he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified thus you see there are some whom the lord resolves to justify why should not you and i be of the number all of grace

this date by soprano saxophonist roberto ottavianos fine quartet is one of the highlights of italian jazz from the era featuring pianist stefano battaglia drummer ettore fioravanti and bassist piero leveratto who also plays banjo the seven tracks here reveal the deep lyrical intricacies of the italian vision of jazz with all compositions being written within the band there is already a seamless dynamic at work in the proceedings that takes into account strengths and weaknesses ottaviano was influenced more by steve lacys technique on the soprano than john coltranes his nuancing of phrase and interval are especially notable on simple bonheur where he moves through a series of complex pitches with a seamless ease winding his lines through battaglias nearly pointillistic melodic construction the complex harmonics at the heart of pamphlet which begin somewhere in the blues lilt over to pastoral modalism and then fly off into a free swinging post-post-bop with a killer bass solo by leveratto the album ends with silhouette which showcases the staggered harmonic inventions of battaglia his lennie tristano-ish lines intersect with the rhythm section in flatted fifths and augmented sevenths before rushing off to the top of the register to engage the blues with ottaviano with a shimmering ostinato yeah now this is jazz

how do we show love many of you probably have a boyfriend of girlfriend depending on your gender and even if you dont you probably have someone to whom you are very close whether it be a friend relative colleague peer or parent no man is an island you know how do we communicate our love to them there are a variety of ways one would be to talk with that person and not necessarily about anything monumental either just to open up and speak freely about anything and everything this demonstrates a level of trust between the participants another is acts of service to give of your time and energy to perform a task for their benefit not for praise or to be patted on the back but just to let them know that you are thinking them and care for their wants and needs both of these require that we give the one thing that we have which can never be replaced our time in a very real way your life is nothing but time breath is just a clock you have so much allotted to you and once its gone it cannot be regained so to give of your time is truly the greatest act of love that you can perform if you are in a relationship the romantic variety you know that all you want to do is to be with that person to do things for them talk to them or just be there even if youre doing nothing more than watching the clouds everything is more beautiful when youre together

i have no doubt made the book sound so grim so perverse and offputting that reading it four times seems only a little less mad than writing it however heller a messy but riotous storyteller in catch shows control of narrative and voice which makes terrible things into compulsive reading rather as thomas bernhards unbroken paragraphs seem initially unwelcoming but propel the reader on the tension comes from wondering what among the few events that actually take place in the book conversations mostly will eventually happen something does and if the something is worth waiting for thats not to say that the long journey there is a slog its a bizarre delight sentence by sentence heller peppers the reader with irony bravery and foolishness sometimes simultaneously the telling is technically immaculate pages of dialogue with multiple counterparties flow faster and faster under the readers thumbs it is structurally brilliant with slocums story flowing unnoticeably from past to present and from one worry to another so the reader has no docking points to get off at even if they wanted to it is a cautionary tale which offers a compellingly nasty angle on a portion of society and the questions people rarely ask of themselves i often wonder what my true nature is do i have one it oozes hot grief from the cracks in its tough cool shell it chucks a bucket of water over the reader when slocum is at his most self-pitying it is too late to gather me all up and put me together again and when he says there are things going on inside me i cannot control and do not admire is he a proto-patrick bateman or just like you and me

a double whammy of awesome i wanted to pick only one terry gilliam movie and his most fantastical adventure comes from the adventures of baron munchausen with s time bandits a close second but once i decided on munchausen that opened up another problem i love karel zemans czechoslovak version just as much so the fabulous baron munchausen aka baron prásil ties with gilliams film sorry original german version both gilliam and zeman were amazingly visual artists in the realm of fantasy and both have extremely distinct styles and tones so both films are wonderful and inventive but in different ways gilliams munchausen features john neville as the eponymous baron going on a great journey to find his old friends and rescue a besieged town from invading turks the baron enters his own story and joined by a little girl sarah polley he flies a hot air balloon to the moon where he saves the impossibly fast berthold eric idle from the zany king of the moon robin williams from there they fall into the volcano of mont etna where vulcan oliver reed and venus uma thurman treat them to a tension-filled tea break and floating waltz then they are tossed into a whirlpool and are swallowed by a sea monster on the opposite side of the world famous for being one of the biggest flops in movie history the film is in fact a staggering achievement from a technical standpoint and for humor-filled fantasy films as well karel zemans version is incredibly stylized and psychedelic his special effects may be older but they are no less baffling or impressive an astronaut lands on the moon only to discover the baron who has been there for quite some time together they go back to earth for one crazy adventure after another as they fight the turks and each other for the attentions of the princess the movie is a wonderful satirical innovative and a visual treat for fantasy lovers of all ages the munchausens are fantasy untethered

of course the most obvious counterargument one could raise against nietzsche in his critique of womanhood is to point out that mostif not allof the criticisms he makes against the opposite here is equally present in the behavior of the masculine gender men too indulge in vain interests and have a tendency to become bitter and sensitive as age starts to diminish their charm and virility not to mention their hairline when it comes to the issue of competitionwhich nietzsche characterizes as a vanityit is only fair to say that if the philosopher wants to state that the highest contempt against women comes from other women then one has to also acknowledge how in light of all of human history the greatest focus of contempt against men has been other men thus doesnt allow itself to conclude that nietzsches criticism of femininity are more accurately understood as criticism against humanity in general personally i doubt that nietzsche would even object to any of the statements i have made above and would probably add that they are entirely compatible with his views furthermore i suspect that the philosopher would make the counter claim that my attempt at refuting his views on women arises largely from my superficial interpretation of his words ie im eager to refute his ideas here because i already decided his views are wrong long before i even started this essay this would not be a false claim in and of itself but whether or not it is the driving force in my analysis ill leave to the reader to judge

perhaps michael sayeau is right when he writes in the guardian that the picture of occupy that emerges from this book is a little too educated too well-argued and too clear to do justice to the more prevalent attitudes of confusion anger and irrationality personally id like see the best qualities of occupy be saved for next generations rather than the mediocre ones another criticism one could give about this book is that it is too busy conveying the excitement adventure and later the daily sorrows of camping out that it fails to properly address its goals aims and experiences as a protest which is a way of saying that occupy is just another middle class vehicle for personal growth there may be a point and maybe not if the citing of violence is the way the system tries to discredit a protest movement calling everybody who appears to be slightly better of then you middle class is the surest way for protest movements to discredit each other
